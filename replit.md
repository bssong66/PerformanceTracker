# Í∞úÏù∏ÏÑ±Í≥º Í¥ÄÎ¶¨Ïï± (Personal Performance Management App)

## Overview

This is a personal productivity and planning application based on Franklin Planner methodology. It's built as a full-stack web application with a React frontend and Express.js backend, using PostgreSQL as the database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store (connect-pg-simple)

### Design System
- **Style**: Minimal design philosophy following the New York variant of Shadcn/UI
- **Colors**: Neutral-based palette with black/white primary colors
- **Typography**: System fonts (Helvetica, Arial)
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with responsive breakpoints

## Key Components

### 1. Foundation Module (Í∞ÄÏπò Ï§ëÏã¨ Í≥ÑÌöç)
- Personal mission statement creation
- Core values definition (3 values maximum)
- Annual goal setting connected to mission and values
- Database tables: `foundations`, `annualGoals`

### 2. Project Management System
- Project creation and lifecycle management
- Project prioritization (high/medium/low)
- Status tracking (planning/in-progress/completed)
- Visual project identification with color coding
- Database table: `projects`

### 3. Task Management with ABC Priority System
- A-level: Critical and urgent tasks
- B-level: Important but not urgent tasks
- C-level: Nice-to-have tasks that can be postponed
- Project-based task organization
- Database table: `tasks` with priority field

### 4. Two-page Daily Management
- Left page: Today's schedule and prioritized tasks
- Right page: Completion tracking, notes, and daily reflection
- Integration with project-based tasks
- Database tables: `tasks`, `timeBlocks`, `dailyReflections`

### 5. Weekly Review System
- Performance tracking: Completed A and B level tasks
- Next week preparation: New priority setting
- Work-life balance check: Work vs personal time ratio
- Values alignment check: Activities alignment with personal values
- Database table: `weeklyReviews`

### 6. Habit Tracking
- Habit creation and management
- Daily habit logging with streak tracking
- Progress visualization
- Database tables: `habits`, `habitLogs`

### 7. Focus Mode
- Pomodoro timer (25-minute sessions)
- A-priority task focus mode
- Distraction blocking features
- Session completion tracking

## Data Flow

### Authentication & User Management
- Mock user system (MOCK_USER_ID = 1) for development
- Session-based authentication ready for implementation
- User-scoped data isolation

### State Management Pattern
- TanStack Query for server state caching and synchronization
- Optimistic updates for better user experience
- Error handling with toast notifications
- Automatic cache invalidation on mutations

### API Design
- RESTful API endpoints following resource-based patterns
- Consistent error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Request/response validation using Zod schemas
- Centralized API client with request/response interceptors

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL serverless database
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **Icons**: Lucide React icon library
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date manipulation and formatting
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Development Dependencies
- **Build Tools**: Vite with React plugin
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript with strict configuration
- **CSS Processing**: PostCSS with Tailwind CSS
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution, ESBuild for bundling

### Replit-specific Integrations
- **Error Handling**: @replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal for development
- **Code Navigation**: @replit/vite-plugin-cartographer for file exploration
- **Development Banner**: Replit development banner script

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Local development with Vite dev server
- Hot module replacement for fast iteration
- TypeScript compilation checking
- Environment-specific configurations

### Production Build
- Vite build for optimized frontend bundle
- ESBuild for server-side code bundling
- Static file serving through Express
- Environment variable configuration for database connections

### Database Management
- Drizzle migrations for schema versioning
- Database push commands for development
- PostgreSQL connection pooling for production scalability
